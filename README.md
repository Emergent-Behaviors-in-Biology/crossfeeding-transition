# crossfeeding-transition

This repository contains the simulation data analyzed in Marsland et al. (2018), "Available energy fluxes drive a transition in the diversity, stability, and functional structure of microbial communities." A detailed description of the algorithms for data generation and analysis, as well as the structure of the data files can be found in the Appendices of the manuscript file `Marsland2018.pdf`. 

The Jupyter notebook `Analysis.ipynb` contains the Python code for loading the data and reproducing the plots from the manuscript and supplement. It requires prior installation of the Community Simulator package, which can be found at <https://github.com/robertvsiii/community-simulator>.
